Rick and Morty app based on "https://rickandmortyapi.com/" public Api.

You can find 2 simple views that may show you 3 Screens, build it with the Apple framework SwiftUI:

## HomeView
    Represent a List of Characters

## DetailsView
    Contains the character Details
    
## LocationView
    Contains the character last Location

- The Networking manager was build with URLSession & generic types

- Finally there is some Unit Testing focused to test the ViewModels & the api calls. To do this there are some mocks with 3 response:
